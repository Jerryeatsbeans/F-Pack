This texture pack allows players to circumvent Minecraft's profanity filter by using a custom Russian font that maps English characters to Cyrillic letters. 

Each English letter corresponds to a random Cyrillic letter, ensuring that the text remains readable while ensuring that the Minecraft Bedrock profanity detection cannot read it, as it only appears to be a jumbled mess of characters.

## Setup

Open the [F-Pack companion tool](https://jerryeatsbeans.github.io/F-Pack/fpack) and have it open in a browser.

```bash
The companion will convert text from "Hello!" to "ЈХЬЬЯ!"
```

## Usage

Install the FPACK.mcpack file and import it into Minecraft. Then paste the generated text from the website wherever you'd like in game and it will appear in standard english
